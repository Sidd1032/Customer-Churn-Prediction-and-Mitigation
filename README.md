Customer Churn Prediction and Mitigation
Tools Used: Python, Machine Learning, Jupyter Notebook

This project focused on analyzing customer behavior to predict the likelihood of churn using advanced analytics and machine learning techniques. Key steps included:

Data Preprocessing:

Cleaned and prepared a dataset containing customer details such as demographic information, subscription tenure, and service usage patterns.
Handled missing values and transformed categorical variables into numerical representations for machine learning algorithms.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized customer behaviors and trends using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Identified key factors correlated with churn, such as contract type, tenure, and monthly charges.
Feature Engineering:

Created new features to enhance model performance, such as tenure buckets and interaction terms between payment methods and churn.
Scaled continuous variables for uniformity across features.
Modeling:

Built and evaluated various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM).
Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to optimize performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Results:

Achieved a high-performing predictive model with accurate churn predictions, enabling identification of high-risk customers.
Interpreted feature importances to provide actionable insights for customer retention strategies.
Mitigation Strategies:

Suggested targeted interventions such as offering personalized discounts, improving support for long-tenured customers, and enhancing services for customers with specific contract types.
Developed a churn dashboard for real-time monitoring of customer segments at risk.
This project demonstrated expertise in data analysis, predictive modeling, and business impact strategy development, ultimately supporting efforts to retain customers and reduce churn.
