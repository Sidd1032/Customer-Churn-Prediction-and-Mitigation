Customer Churn Prediction and Mitigation

Tools Used: Python, Machine Learning, Jupyter Notebook

Objective:
The goal of this project was to analyze customer behavior and predict churn using advanced analytics and machine learning techniques. By identifying customers likely to churn, businesses can implement targeted retention strategies to reduce customer turnover and improve profitability.

Steps Undertaken:

Data Understanding and Preprocessing:

The dataset contained key columns like customerID, gender, SeniorCitizen, tenure, InternetService, Contract, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges, and the target column Churn.
Missing values in TotalCharges were imputed appropriately, and data types were corrected to ensure consistency.
Features such as Contract, PaymentMethod, and InternetService were encoded using one-hot or label encoding techniques.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized churn distribution to understand the proportion of customers leaving.
Analyzed correlations between features and churn. For example:
Customers with shorter tenure or month-to-month contracts showed higher churn rates.
Higher MonthlyCharges correlated with a higher likelihood of churn, particularly for customers with premium services.
Generated visualizations (e.g., histograms, bar charts, and heatmaps) to identify trends and insights.
Feature Engineering:

Derived new features, such as average charges per tenure, to capture customer behavior trends.
Normalized numerical variables (tenure, MonthlyCharges, etc.) to enhance model performance.
Model Development:

Used supervised machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Split the data into training and testing sets (80:20) and applied stratified sampling to balance the target variable.
Evaluated models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to measure their ability to identify churn.
Random Forest and Gradient Boosting showed the best performance, with an AUC-ROC score above 85%.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Optimized models using techniques like Grid Search and Randomized Search to improve accuracy and generalization.
Insights and Mitigation Strategies:

Identified high-risk customer segments (e.g., customers with month-to-month contracts or those with low tenure).
Proposed retention strategies such as offering discounts for long-term contracts, improving service quality, and personalizing customer engagement.
Deployment and Evaluation:

Built a predictive system to flag high-risk customers in real-time using Python and deployed it in a test environment.
Regularly monitored model performance and updated it with new data to ensure its relevance.
Outcome:
The project successfully demonstrated the use of machine learning to predict churn with high accuracy, enabling proactive retention efforts. Insights derived from the analysis allowed the creation of targeted strategies, leading to a potential reduction in churn and improvement in customer satisfaction.
